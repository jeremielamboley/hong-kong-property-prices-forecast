# Predicting Hong Kong house prices using different regressions and decision trees techniques

The objective of the project is to compare the performance of different machine learning forecasting techniques.
The code is available as Python notebooks.

## Main features

* extract SQL data
* clean-up the data and prepare it for modeling
* perform data visualizations
* apply machine learning models and compare their performances

## Credits

Special thanks to:
* Guy Freeman (https://github.com/slygent) for providing the original Hong Kong real estate dataset

## Software and Libraries

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets#install)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has most of the above packages (except scrapy) and more included. 

## Contributing & Developing
